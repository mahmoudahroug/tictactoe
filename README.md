# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a Tic Tac Toe game implemented using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and C#. It allows players to enjoy the classic game either in multiplayer mode or against a computer opponent. The AI for the computer player is implemented using the minimax algorithm.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Mode:** Play against another human player on the same computer.
- **Single Player Mode:** Challenge the computer in a game of Tic Tac Toe.
- **Minimax Algorithm:** The computer player uses the minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves and provide a challenging experience.
- **Interactive Interface:** The game features a user-friendly interface built using WPF, providing an enjoyable gaming experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Tic Tac Toe game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
3. Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
4. Run the application to start playing Tic Tac Toe.

## How to Play

- **Multiplayer Mode:** Select the multiplayer option from the main menu. Players can take turns clicking on the grid to place their respective symbols (X or O).
- **Single Player Mode:** Choose the single-player option from the main menu. You will be prompted to select your difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard). The computer will make its moves based on the chosen difficulty level.
- **Winning Condition:** The first player to align three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the grid fills up without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## About the Minimax Algorithm

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player turn-based games. It evaluates all possible moves that both players can make and selects the best move for the computer player, assuming the opponent also plays optimally. This ensures that the computer provides a challenging opponent in single-player mode.
